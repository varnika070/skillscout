# SkillScout

AI-powered, community-driven learning paths for Indian learners.

## Overview
SkillScout helps learners understand *what to learn next* by generating clear, step-by-step learning paths instead of overwhelming them with content. It focuses on guidance, learning order, and explainability.

## What this repository contains
- `ask_requirements.md` – problem statement, user needs, and requirements
- `design.md` – high-level system and experience design

## Problem
Many learners in India rely on scattered resources and lack clarity on learning order, prerequisites, and skill progression, leading to confusion and dropouts.

## Solution
SkillScout uses AI to break down learning goals into prerequisite-aware paths and enriches them with community insights, making learning more structured, accessible, and confidence-driven.
